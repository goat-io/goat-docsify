# Release Notes

> GOAT is not yet ready for production! The API might change so use this carefully

### Current Version

The current release is still missing some pieces that we will include during the next weeks/months to come. This new functionalities could potentially generate breaking changes to how the api is generated or the naming conventions that we use for classes, API routes, database/collections names and user and role management (Basically, everything). So until we announce our first stable release, please use this as a nice PoC of the potential benefits that we want to deliver to the dev community.

If you want to contribute to the development, we will be happy to have you on board! Just follow the contribution rules and create your PRÂ´s.
