### Current scenario

The data collection process considers at least 8 different stages that must be planned to have a successful project. The different stages are shown in Figure 1

At an early stage, different teams have to design the research or project that will be created. This step not only includes the scientific research that motivates the project, but also expected input and outcomes of the project itself in term of data and information. Once the data and possible information or outcomes from the data have been stablished, all surveys, form inputs or wanted data structures are planned to work as an input for the development teams for them to guarantee that the data that the users are going to input has the right type, format, and passes all required validations, to avoid a work overload in the next stage of the process.

Once data has been collected, it must be cleaned to avoid unwanted inputs. At this stage is not uncommon to find test submissions or data that even when it passes all the validations, we would choose to discard or not show for some reason. The cleansing and validation stage is one of the most relevant to allow a successful data output.

Once the data has been cleaned, it should be stored in an organized manner to allow for long term storage and retrieval taking in consideration the availability levels that the data should comply to.
Following the data storage process, the research/project teams should be able access it and manipulate it to retrieve results and possible answers to the research questions. From the technology perspective, it is important they are able to connect to the data using the tools that they manage or feel comfortable using, and in the case the research or project team does not know the proper tools to use, is the IT division who should recommend one for them.

When the project teams have already explored and processed the data, they will want to generate different types of visualizations on top of it. This visualization could also have been defined on early stages of the research or design of the project, if the projects already knew at that stage the wanted outputs in terms of data visualization, but it also possible to have scenarios where relevant information was discovered in the exploring phase and new visualizations must be generated to later communicate the findings. 

After all visualizations are ready, the last stage of the process is to communicate the results. This process could include also exposing the data publically thus it is extremely important to comply with the ethic and privacy regulations of the organization.
