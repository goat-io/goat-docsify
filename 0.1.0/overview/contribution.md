# Contribution Guide

> GOAT is an Open Source project licensed under MIT. You can use it for any purpose!

## Reporting Bugs

All of the code for the different Open Source tools that Goat provides are openly accessibly on Github. We are following the development there, so feel free to post the bugs in the issue section of the corresponding repository.
We encourage you to not only find the problems, but also give it a try and send us a pull request with the fix! Most of the code is no magic, pretty straight forward TS. If we managed to develop it, you can work on the code base too!

## Requesting Features

Just like Bugs, you are free to request new Features, have in mind that we donÂ´t have a dedicated team for this, so again please go ahead and contribute with an amazing PR.
