### Proposed Solution

Data collection projects have several stages that must be covered to achieve a successful project. All of the stages have their own complexity levels and require a well-defined structure and internal processes to easy the development process of new projects.
The FAST framework considers that at least there should be 5 different teams to cover every stage of the Data Collection process.


1.  APP DEVELOPMENT
2.	NO-SQL DB MANAGEMENT, ETL AND CORPORATE API MANAGEMENT
3.  BIG DATA, BI AND AI
4.  DATA VISUALIZATION
5.  DATA DISSEMINATION

And at least 4 roles working across all centers

1.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS
2.  QA
3.  SDLC
4.  UI / UX

Every team has it's own defined activities fitting the data collection Stages as follows.

### Required Competencies: Centers of Excellence

Every development team will form a “Center of Excellence”. As every center of excellence has a specific goal in the data collection process and every center depends on the others to completely deliver a project, they must follow the black box approach. Every center has its own well defined input and they offer a well-defined output to the next stage of the process. What happens inside of each of the centers in terms of technologies or tools to use should only concern the center itself, as long as they maintain their compliance levels and the follow the previously defined standardization for input and output.

- HYBRID APP DEVELOPMENT: Data Collection and app development

The data collection and app development team will be the responsible of the overall functionalities of any FAO internally developed application. Is their responsibility to develop the required forms and functionalities to then place them properly on the applications based on the client’s requirements. Also this center will be responsible of developing any type of customization that the application may require in terms of data flow, role based permissions and customized layouts. At the same time, this team will integrate in the applications all custom visualizations, charts or views created by the Data Visualization team if required.

- NO-SQL DB Management, ETL and Corporate API management: Sharing, storing and ETL of Data

The ETL data storing and sharing team will have the responsibility of taking the data collected by the applications and move, transform or create custom calculations on top of it. Using the Data input from the Development team, they will use all available technologies to create Data flows to enable long term solutions for storing and sharing the data. Is their responsibility to maintain all associated systems to guarantee the consistency and availability of the collected data, also this team will create and maintain all associated corporate API’s to give secure and controlled access to the information. 

- BIG DATA, BI AND AI: Data processing and Advanced Statistics

  The Data processing team will be responsible of exploring and supporting customize uses of new technologies to gather relevant information on top of the collected data. Their main goal is to give tools to advanced users or scientist to manipulate the data to generate new information on top of it. Also this team will give the users the tools to validate the data before publishing it or using it for generating advanced statistics models for understanding or predicting events.

- DATA VISUALIZATION: Reporting and visualization

 The data reporting and visualization team will create all visualization required by the user, no matter if they are charts inside the applications, external dashboard or reports, all types of data visualizations will be handled by the reporting and visualization team. This team will also be responsible of handling the finalize visualizations to the Development team in case that in App custom visualizations are required.

- DATA DISSEMINATION: Publishing results and Marketing 

The data dissemination team will be responsible of publishing the created content in the different areas under FAO’s standards and to connect all sources and visualizations of data to FAO platforms.

Every center on the data collection process has an explicit functionality to cover, this structure will allow each one to generate internal knowledge that will remain inside the center regardless of the people working inside. To allow this separation of concerns between centers and to maximize the flexibility of choosing technologies to each one, it is required to define the input and output on every step of the process that will work as a binding contract that each center must comply to.
