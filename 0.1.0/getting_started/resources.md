# Resources

A resource defines a set of **_API_** endpoints in your application. Resources follow the **_REST_** convention and all basic APIÂ´s endpoints will be auto-generated when using **_Manager_**

When working with **_Goat_** you are **NOT** forced to use Manager to generate your endpoints. We know that even when it is convenient for 80% of the cases, sometimes you just want a single route or custom logic over the code. So other than the folder structure, you can go ahead an use your **_Loopback / NestJS_** backend as you like. Remember that **_Goat_** is not the framework here!
