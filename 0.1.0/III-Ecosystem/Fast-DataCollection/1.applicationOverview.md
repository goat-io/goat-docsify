### Core Functionalities

The FAST data collection app (COOL_APP_NAME) is a VUE.js project built using Quasar Framework and Cordova.
By using COOL_APP_NAME you will automatically have a hibryd application that you will be able to deploy to any device, no matter
if you are looking to build a Windows, Mac, IOS or Android app all X components are meant to be platform agnostic, giving
you the same experience on every platform

### Flexible Form and layout creation.

The core component of COOL_APP_NAME is Form.io, thanks to this library we are able to flexibly define
forms and form logic to later export it to a JSON schema. Even the application itself, layout and
functionallities can be modified directly using Form.io, giving us the possibility to add/remove
pages or add/remove user permissions or access without the need to redeploy the app over and over,
everything you see is defined as a JSON schema and can be modified on the fly

### Offline first

Most of the times, we collect data on remote places, where Internet connectivity can be intermitent or even unexistent. COOL_APP_NAME was design to easy the data collection projects by managing OFFLINE submissions and as all the application
and Forms are just JSON schemas everything gets stored locally to give you full access to the APP even when you are
OFFLINE.
Using COOL_APP_NAME will require you to have internet connection the first time you open it, and once you
are logged in, you can disconnect safely to go and gather data. Once you are back online, all you need to do is to open
the application and all submissions will automatically sync back to the servers, no buttons, no interventions, just works...
