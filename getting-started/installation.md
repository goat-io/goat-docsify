## Installation

### Server requirements

GOAT has minimal system requirements. As it is a **_NODE.JS_** Framework, getting started is as easy as installing **_NODE.JS_** on your machine. Even when it could be possible to develop using **_DOCKER_**, we recommend having node installed to ease the process. We will use **_DOCKER_** for deployment and other purposes.

#### Installing Node.JS
