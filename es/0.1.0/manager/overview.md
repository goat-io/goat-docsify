# Overview

> A frontend for your backend. _**Form.io**_, _**Loopback**_, _**Swagger**_, _**ArchitectUI**_ and a lot of _**Love**_ glued together

**_Manager_** is the combination of several open source tools that will change the way you code. It´s main goal is to help developers of any level/seniority and people without coding experience to build a "real-world working, code based" backend for their projects.

As stated on **_Goat´s_** overview, we had the chance to play around with many code generators in the making process of this tool and, even when they are all excellent tools, there was one thing that all had in common, the end result of the backend is dependant on a database or, the generated code has a proprietary structure and you don´t even have backend code.

For us, it was extremely important to have a backend that would work as any other developer written backend would. So we wanted to have the structure that the base framework proposes for their community and we wanted to use the code standards that the given community of the framework uses.

Therefore, every time that you use **_Manager_**, you will be generating code that is based on what it is documented as guideline by the framework, pretty much what you would end up having if you went through the docs of the given framework and started creating your API.

**_Goat_** ahead and check how it works!
