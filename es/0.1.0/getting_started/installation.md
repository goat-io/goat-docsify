# Installation

## Server requirements

GOAT has minimal system requirements. As it is a **_Node.JS_** tool, getting started is as easy as installing **_Node.JS_** on your machine. Even when it could be possible to develop using **_Docker_**, we recommend having node installed to ease the process. We will use **_Docker_** for deployment and other purposes.

### Installing Node.JS

To install Node.JS in your environment follow these instructions, depending on you OS.

## Installing GOAT

GOAT can be used either with NPM or YARN. So, before using GOAT, make sure you have at least one of them installed on your machine.
Open your terminal and follow these steps

Using NPM

```bash
npm install --global @goatlab/cli

```

Once installed, your machine should have the goat command available. Verify the installation by running

```bash
goat

```

You should see the available commands that goat-cli provides.

The `goat new` command will create a new GOAT project in the directory you specify. For instance, `goat new app` will create a directory named app containing a fresh GOAT installation with all of GOAT's dependencies already installed

```bash
goat new app

```

Select the framework that you want to use for the backend

> The installation process will take a couple minutes. The goat-fluent package is quite big as it is a mono repo with everything you need for development. DonÂ´t worry, your final build will not include all of that!

Once everything is ready, you will see the following messages.

And then, if you go inside the "app" folder using `cd app && ls`. You will find a fresh Goat installation

### Local Development Server

As we already have **_Node.JS_** installed in our machine, starting the development server is as easy as running `goat serve` inside the project's folder. This command will start the API server at `http://localhost:3001` and the API manager at `http://localhost:3001/#`

![alt text](imgs/cli-serve.png "Goat serve")

```bash
goat serve

```

The Api manager will be [http://localhost:3001/#](http://localhost:3001/#)

Loopback comes with Swagger out of the box, so you can also check the API using Swagger directly by going to [http://localhost:3001/explorer](http://localhost:3001/explorer)
