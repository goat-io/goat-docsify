# Motivation

### Why did we create Goat?

> Goat, **NOT** a Framework but a collection of good Open Source tools.

#### The Beggining

Creating APPS is a difficult job. There are many different frameworks out there and every single one has pro's and con's, like someone wrote a few years back, there is no silver bullet. This means that at some point you will have to make the decision to compromise with one of them (or none).

For us, the decision came many years ago. We started using **_Laravel (PHP)_**, and we simply loved it (we still do). Everything around the framework is fantastic, especially it's documentation syntaxis and of course, it's community.

#### The Problem

Our first problem came in 2016, when we needed to create an APP to manage RFC's for a large Cloud provider. The Forms that we needed to manage were quite big (400 - 1200 fields) and as you can imagine every section had this "dynamic" tables where you could add more resources. **_Laravel_** did the job. Of course it was possible to do all of these using it!, but somehow it didn't feel right. There was a general feel of disconnection between the **API** generated and the **VIEWS**, in terms that we felt like we were developing the same things twice, first we needed to define models, migrations, endpoints and then probably some data validation on the server and later we had to pretty much repeat the process but this time, on the client. Every time we needed to change a field, we needed to do it in both places (which is normal) but after the first docen models we found ourselfs doing the same things over and over. **_Something needed to change_**

#### Looking for alternatives

We started checking different Admin Panel generators, but we tought that they were hidding too much of the process, and some of them were tightly couple with their own frontends, not giving too much room for extension. Later on, we started using **_Loopback 3_**. We were extreamly happy on how easy it was to generate fully functional API's given a **single JSON defition**.

With **_Loopback 3_** the process of generating and mantaining the API's became almost trivial, at least for the basic (and not so basic) **CRUD** operations and for everything outside of this scope, we could always define new routes with custom logic. Even when **_Loopback 3_** was doing a wonderful job, we still had the problem of repeating logic on the client, but at least this time it was all **_JS_**.

#### Autogenerators and hosted solutions

So now we started looking for tools that could help us developing this forms with the minimal possible effort, but the maximum flexibility given our restrictions. We found some incredible tools out there [Magpi](https://home.magpi.com/), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), [Formstack](https://www.formstack.com), [SurveyMonkey](https://surveymonkey.com), [Survey Solutions](https://mysurvey.solutions/),[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) etc.. all of them again offering different alternatives to ease the development process.

In the middle of this process we found a tool that we really loved [Form.io]("https://www.form.io/"). **Form.io** not only allows the creation of the form it self, but at the same time, defines the underlying API in NODE by reusing the same logic in frontend and backend. **This was exactly what we were looking for!** and to turn the scale even more, [Form.io]("https://www.form.io/") is a completly Open Source project (with a paid cloud alternative) so there were no doubts that this was the approach that we needed to take. All [Form.io]("https://www.form.io/") forms have a JSON base definition, so it felt familiar to work with, just like we did before with **_Loopback 3_**.

#### And then we found problems.

Even with all the benefits that [Form.io]("https://www.form.io/") had, we now face a different problem. We had the basic API running, the forms were defined in JSON format so they were portable and "agnostic" but sadly the NODE API generated by Form.io was not as extensible as we would like (trade off's again!). The API was generated on top of EXPRESS so technically we could extend however we liked, but in the process we had the feeling that we were creating a full framework, and we didn't like the idea. So basically this time we where on the opposite site of the problem, good forms good basic API but little room for custom endpoints.

#### Aaand we created GOAT.

Given our journey, we now know exactly what we like. We love Laravel, Form.io Loopback and all the tools that we have seen, but somehow we want to mix them together, without the need to create a new framework, just by finding thiese reusable Open Sources pieces and glueing them together.
At the same time, we wanted to give especial enfasis on extensivility, giving developers flexibility to do whatever they like, while we take care of the tedious/repetitive work.
